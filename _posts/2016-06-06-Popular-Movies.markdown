The purpose of this project is to build an app that helps the user to discover movie details and view trailers based on the priority selected, i.e Most popular, Top rated and favorite. The Favorite section contains offline movies details stored using SQLite Database. Whenever a poster is selected, it launches a detail screen that contain movies details like ratings, overview, trailer, release date, comments and a button to add movie to favorite.
